    shortDescription:
      'Rare cactuses taken illegally from the driest place on Earth are finally going home. \n' +
      '\n' +
      'Cactuses in the genuses Copiapoa and Eriosyce grow in arid regions in northern Chile, such as the Atacama Desert, and a number of these species are highly prized by specialist collectors for landscaping and as houseplants.',
    description:
      'However, Chile does not allow export of the cactuses, making them a popular target for poachers. Hundreds of the plants were stolen from the wild between 2013 and 2019, representatives of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said in a statement on April 26.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Officials confiscated 1,035 of the illegally traded cactuses in Italy during two raids in 2020 — the largest such seizure in Italy to date, IUCN representatives reported in December. These raids were the culmination of a yearlong effort called "Operation Atacama," in which Italian and Chilean authorities collaborated with the IUCN to recover stolen plants and send them back to Chile, according to the April statement.

    title: "Here's how plants became meat eaters",
    shortDescription:
      "Carnivorous plants are the 'most skillful green hunters on the planet.'About 70 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, a genetic anomaly allowed some plants to turn into meat eaters. This was done in part, with a stealthy trick: repurposing genes meant for their roots and leaves and using them instead to catch prey, a new study finds.",
    description:
      'This step is one of three that some non-carnivorous plants took over tens of millions of years to allow them to turn into hungry carnivores, the researchers said.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The meat-eating shift gave these plants a number of advantages. In effect, "carnivorous plants have turned the tables by capturing and consuming nutrient-rich animal prey, enabling them to thrive in nutrient-poor soil," the researchers wrote in the study, published online May 14 in the journal Current Biology.'

    title: "Don't Waste Your Emotions on Plants, They Have No Feelings, Grumpy Scientists Say\n",
    shortDescription:
      'A tree falls in the woods; but whether or not anyone hears it, the tree has no regrets. Nor does it experience fear, anger, relief or sadness as it topples to the ground. Trees — and all plants, for that matter — feel nothing at all, because consciousness, emotions and cognition are hallmarks of animals alone, scientists recently reported in an opinion article.',
    description:
      'The idea that plants have some degree of consciousness first took root in the early 2000s; the term "plant neurobiology" was coined around the notion that some aspects of plant behavior could be compared to intelligence in animals. Though plants lack brains, the firing of electrical signals in their stems and leaves nonetheless triggered responses that hinted at consciousness, researchers previously reported.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "But such an idea is bunk, according to the authors of the new article. Plant biology is complex and fascinating, but it differs so greatly from that of animals that so-called evidence of plants' intelligence is intriguing but inconclusive, the scientists wrote.

    title: "'Demon Orchid' Has a 'Devil Head' and Claw-Like Petals",
    shortDescription:
      "A new species of orchid is in a league of its own — not just because it's relatively rare, but also because scientists say it looks like the devil.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'The new species, Telipogon diabolicus, was named for its gynostemium, the orchid\'s reproductive structure, which looks like a devil\'s head. The orchid is also described as having "distinctly clawed petals," adding to its demonic appearance, according to the researchers who discovered it.',
    description:
      'About 30 of the reddish to dark-violet-maroon orchids — of which only several were flowering adults — were found growing in a small forest at the border between Putumayo and Nariño (regional jurisdictions called "departments") in southern Colombia. [See Photos of Stunning Orchids].In their report on the species\' discovery, the researchers noted that the flower has already been listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, which lists animals and plants threatened with extinction.'

    title: 'Marijuana May Trigger Allergies in Some People',
    shortDescription:
      'Just like ragweed and birch trees, marijuana plants may trigger allergic reactions in some people, according to a new review of previous studies.',
    description:
      "And because of the increasing use and cultivation of marijuana that has followed in the wake of legalization in some places, allergies to marijuana may be on the rise, experts say. People can be allergic to the plant's pollen, or to its smoke.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '"Although still relatively uncommon, allergic disease associated with [marijuana] exposure and use has been reported with increased frequency," wrote the authors of the review, published March 3 in the journal Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.In fact, allergies to marijuana have likely gone underreported, because of marijuana\'s illegal status, said Dr. Purvi Parikh, an immunologist of the Allergy & Asthma Network, a nonprofit organization that promotes allergy research and education.'
